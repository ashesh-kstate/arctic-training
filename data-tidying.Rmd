```{r}
catch_original <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                           stringsAsFactors = FALSE )
head(catch_original)
```

Remove the `all` and `notesRegcode` columns using `select`

Ctrl + Shft + m : pipe operator shortcut %>%

```{r}
# select 'wide' data
catch_long <- catch_original %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>%   # or select(-All, -notesRegCode) select columns we want
  gather(key = "species", value = "catch", # move from wide to long
         -Region, -Year)  # have two primary / non-specie columns present in new table

head(catch_long)
```


```{r}
catch_wide <- catch_long %>% 
  spread(key = Region, value = catch) # spread is opposite to gather

head(catch_wide)

```
