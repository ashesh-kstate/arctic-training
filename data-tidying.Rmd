# Reformat Catch Data

* remove "all"" column
* create "specie" column
    - move from wide to long
* general QA

[Mike Byerly. Alaska commercial salmon catches by management region (1886- 1997). Gulf of Alaska Data Portal. df35b.304.2.] (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/df35b.304.2)


```{r}
catch_original <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                           stringsAsFactors = FALSE )
head(catch_original)

```

Remove the `all` and `notesRegcode` columns using `select`

Ctrl + Shft + m : pipe operator shortcut %>%

```{r}
# select 'wide' data
catch_long <- catch_original %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) %>%   # or select(-All, -notesRegCode) select columns we want
  gather(key = "species", value = "catch", # move from wide to long
         -Region, -Year)  # have two primary / non-specie columns present in new table

head(catch_long)
```


```{r}
catch_wide <- catch_long %>% 
  spread(key = Region, value = catch) # spread is opposite to gather

head(catch_wide)

```

## Cleanup our data

* rename catch to catch_thousands
* change catch solumn to numeric
* create a new catch column in units num. of fish 
 
```{r}
catch_clean <- catch_long %>% 
  rename(catch_thousands = catch) %>% 
  # mutate(catch_thousands = ifelse(catch_thousands %in% c("I", "M", "Z"), 1, catch_thousands)) %>%  # this is for more than 1 error
  mutate(catch_thousands = ifelse(catch_thousands == "I", 1, catch_thousands)) %>% 
  mutate(catch_thousands = as.numeric(catch_thousands)) %>% 
  mutate(catch = catch_thousands * 1000) %>% 
  select(-catch_thousands)

head(catch_clean)
```

Look at where as.numeric failed. This is a test for incorrect data entry / incorrect dimension/unit/... 
This block/chunk can be removed/muted after the fix of missing/invalid data implemented 

```{r}
test <- as.numeric(catch_long$catch)
i <- which(is.na(test) == TRUE)
catch_long[i,]
```

## Split - Apply - Combine

* calculate mean catch by species

```{r}
# species_mean <- catch_clean %>% 
#   group_by(species, Region) %>% 
#   summarise(catch_mean = mean(catch),
#     num_obs = length( whcih(is.na(catch) == F )))#n()
# 
# head(species_mean)
  

year_mean <- catch_clean %>% 
  group_by(Year, species) %>% #species, Region) %>% 
  summarise(catch_mean = mean(catch)) %>% 
  arrange(-Year, desc(species)) %>% # catch_mean) %>% 
  filter(Year >= 1990 & Year <= 1995) 
  

head(year_mean)
```


# Join the Region Definitions



```{r}
region_defs <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.303.1",
                            method = "libcurl"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
    select(code, mgmtArea) %>% 
    rename(Region = code) # rename to match names of join fields
    

head(region_defs)

```

```{r}
catch_joined <- left_join(catch_clean, region_defs, by = "Region" ) # c("Region" = "code"))

# catch_joined <- inner_join(catch_clean, region_defs, by = "Region" ) # c("Region" = "code"))


# catch_joined <- catch_clean %>% 
#  left_join(region_defs)

head(catch_joined)
```



# Miscellanious Functions

```{r}
dates_df <- data.frame(date = c("5/24/1930",
                                "5/25/1930",
                                "5/26/1930",

                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```{r}

```

```{r}

  unite(col = date_iso, year, month, day, sep = "-") # recommend 'lubridate' package for date manipulation

head(dates_unite)
```

```{r}
# recommend package 'stringr' for string manipulation 
library(stringr)

month <- c("5", "01", "003")

str_pad(month, 2, side = "left", pad = "0")

```

```{r}
